## 🛠 Methods & Analysis
- **Data Wrangling**: Handling missing values, cleaning, and formatting.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical analysis and visualizations.  
- **Visualization Tools**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for trends and insights.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluating relationships between key performance indicators (KPIs).

## 📊 Key Findings
- Teams with higher possession generally performed better, but possession alone does not guarantee victory.  
- Certain teams showed **consistent improvement** over multiple seasons based on goal differences and win rates.  

More detailed results can be found in the **Jupyter Notebook**.
